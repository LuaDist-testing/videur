Videur
======

Pronounced:  */vidœʀ/*

***experimental project***

Videur is a Lua library for OpenResty that will automatically parse
an API specification file provided by a web server and proxy incoming
Nginx requests to that server.

Videur takes care of rejecting requests that do not comply with the
specification definitions, such as:

- unknown GET arguments
- bad types or out of limits arguments
- missing authorization headers
- POST body too big
- too many requests per second on a given API
- etc..

To get a detailed list of rules that can be used,
look at the `Videur API Specification 0.1
document <https://github.com/mozilla/videur/blob/master/spec/VAS.rst>`_


Installation
------------

To install Videur, you need to have an OpenResty environment deployed.

Then you can run::

	luarock install videur


Usage
-----

Using Videur in Nginx is done in three directives.

First of all, you need to define a couple of Lua shared dicts:

- **cached_spec**, where Videur will store the API specification the backend provided
- **stats**, where Videur keeps track of the hits for its rate limiting feature

Then you need to set a **spec_url** variable with the URL of the API spec.
This URL should be a JSON document as defined in the `Videur API
Specification 0.1 document <https://github.com/mozilla/videur/blob/master/spec/VAS.rst>`_

Last, the **access_by_lua_file** directive needs to point to the
**dynamic_proxy_pass.lua** script from the Videur library.


Example::

    http {
        lua_shared_dict cached_spec 512k;
        lua_shared_dict stats 512k;

        server {
            listen 80;
            set $spec_url "http://127.0.0.1:8282/api-specs";
            access_by_lua_file "dynamic_proxy_pass.lua";
        }
    }
